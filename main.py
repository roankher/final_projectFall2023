We realized that we were all passionate about tracking sports scores in real time and we are all involved in fantasy sports in some way. 
We wanted to create an algorithim to predict the future scores of NFL games and stats of the players while also providing the real time scores
We are planning to use different APIs to track scores and use statistical models of linear regression to predict the yard totals of players and the results of games. 
'''
'''
Goals:
Create a predictive NFL sports betting model in python that will provide users with accurate NFL game projections and bets with positive
Expected Value (EV)
Using statistics to predict the best bets on sportsbooks websites. 
Tracking sports scores on different tables and finding links to all the games. 
Importing historical data from website and use it to predict future data
